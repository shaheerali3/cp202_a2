     web-browser's cache exists because internet speed is slower than computer speed when retrieving files or folders. It is much faster to obtain a file on a computer's hard disk than to get a file that is stored online via the internet. As a result, retrieving a file is much faster if it is stored after being downloaded once as opposed to downloading the file every time it is needed. That is all that the cache of a web- browser is: A place where files are stored once they are downloaded, in case they are needed for retrieval again in the future.

      A web-browser's cache has a limit. When the cache becomes full, the files in the cache that have not been used for a long period of time
must be deleted to make room for new files to be downloaded and stored. Clearing the cache means to emtpy all previously downloaded files and folders
within the cache. Once the cache is emptied, every web page that is viewed afterwards will require downloading of new files and folders. This is the reason
why clearing cookies in this web-browser allows the mailchimp form on the homepage to be reset. When cookies are cleared, any webpage visited afterwards
will download new copies of all files and folders on the webpage, allowing the mailchimp form to pop-up once again.
